# TP_Clustering

This project is a machine learning tutorial focusing on **clustering**, where the objective is to use the **K-Means** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** algorithms to analyse geographical data. The data comes from the **World Health Organisation (WHO)** and includes spatial information (longitude, latitude) from different countries, making it possible to identify geographical patterns such as continents.

## Objectives

1. **View geographic data sets**: Explore spatial data using the Mercator projection.
2. **Apply the K-Means and GMM algorithms**: Compare the performance of these algorithms for geographic clustering.
3. **Normalise the data**: Move the origin of the longitudes to improve the quality of the clusters.
4. **Propose a methodology to detect specific clusters**: For example, Caribbean islands.
5. **Evaluate cluster quality**: Use silhouette and homogeneity scores to evaluate results.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you need the following:
- Python 3.6** or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - pandas
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
